Steps followed
Built a comprehensive Power BI dashboard connecting orders, transactions, and budget data. It now tracks:

YTD Sales vs Budget

Category/Segment behavior

Payment preferences

Profit by Product Line

I designed an end-to-end Promo AirPods Sales Dashboard in Power BI by integrating raw sales, budget, and product-level data.

âœ… Unified Data Model: Combined 3 data sources (Orders, Details, Budget) with clean relationships and DAX-driven logic.

âœ… YTD Sales Intelligence: Compared 2023 vs 2022 YTD figures, normalized to todayâ€™s date, to give a fair growth percentage.

âœ… Budget vs Actual Tracking: Showed where actual sales stand against projected 2023 budgets, enabling proactive decision-making.

âœ… Profitability by Sub-Category: Highlighted top-performing AirPods models based on net profit, helping marketing prioritize promotions.

âœ… Customer Segmentation: Visualized sales breakdown by Category (Male/Female/Unisex) and Payment Mode, offering actionable insights on buyer behavior.

âœ… Monthly Trend Visualization: Used an area chart to show profit drop-offs or spikes by month, ideal for aligning marketing and supply chain.

âœ… UX Optimized for Leadership: Used KPIs, slicers (by gender), tooltips, and clean layout for a dashboard that enables leadership to make decisions fast â€” no digging required.

âœ… Scalable for Future Campaigns: The model can be easily extended to other product lines or seasonal campaigns by simply updating the source files.

for creating new column following DAX expression was written;

ðŸ§® 1. YTD Sales 2023 dax Copy Edit YTD Sales 2023 = CALCULATE( SUM(Details_1[Amount]), FILTER( Orders_1, YEAR(Orders_1[Order Date]) = 2023 && Orders_1[Order Date] <= TODAY() ) )

ðŸ§® 2. YTD Sales 2022 dax Copy Edit YTD Sales 2022 = CALCULATE( SUM(Details_1[Amount]), FILTER( Orders_1, YEAR(Orders_1[Order Date]) = 2022 && Orders_1[Order Date] <= DATE(2022, MONTH(TODAY()), DAY(TODAY())) ) )

ðŸ§® 3. Growth % (2022 vs 2023) dax Copy Edit Growth 22 vs 23 = DIVIDE( [YTD Sales 2023] - [YTD Sales 2022], [YTD Sales 2022] )

ðŸ§® 4. Budget 2023 dax Copy Edit Budget 2023 = CALCULATE( SUM(Budget[Amount]), Budget[Year] = 2023 )

ðŸ§® 5. Profit by Sub-Category Use in a visual:

Axis: Details_1[Sub-Category]

Values: SUM(Details_1[Profit])

Or create a measure:

dax Copy Edit Total Profit = SUM(Details_1[Profit])

ðŸ§® 6. Profit by Month Ensure Order Date is in the axis (Month format) and plot:

SUM(Details_1[Profit])

SUM(Details_1[Amount])

Optional Measures:

dax Copy Edit Monthly Profit = CALCULATE( SUM(Details_1[Profit]), FILTER( Orders_1, YEAR(Orders_1[Order Date]) = 2023 ) )

Monthly Sales = CALCULATE( SUM(Details_1[Amount]), FILTER( Orders_1, YEAR(Orders_1[Order Date]) = 2023 ) )

ðŸ§® 7. Payment Mode Share (for pie chart) Use:
